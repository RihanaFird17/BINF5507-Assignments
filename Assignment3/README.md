# Clustering Algorithm Comparison: DBSCAN, K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering
## Description
This assignment compares three clustering algorithms: DBSCAN, k-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering using synthetic datasets generated by sklearn.datasets. The goal is to assess the performance of each algorithm based on clustering accuracy and silhouette scores across different datasets, including "moons," "blobs," and "circles."

## Key Points
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based algorithm, good for identifying clusters with arbitrary shapes and noise.
- **k-Means**: A centroid-based algorithm that performs well on spherical clusters with similar densities.
- **Hierarchial (Agglomerative) Clustering**: A hierarchical clustering method, useful for a range of clustering structures but computationally more expensive.

## Datasets
- **make_moons**: Crescent-shaped clusters.
- **make_blobs**: Spherical clusters with varying densities.
- **make_circles**: Concentric circles that are non-linearly separable.

## Code Structure 
- **apply_clustering():** Function to apply DBSCAN, KMeans, and Hierarchical Clustering
- **plot_clustering():** Function to plot the clustering results 
- **compare_performance():** Function to compute and print silhouette scores for comparison

## Results
Here are the silhouette scores for the clustering algorithms across the datasets:

- **make_moons:**
  - DBSCAN: 0.33
  - k-Means: 0.39
  - Agglomerative Clustering: 0.31
  
- **make_blobs:**
  - DBSCAN: 0.72
  - k-Means: 0.78
  - Agglomerative Clustering: 0.78

- **make_circles:**
  - DBSCAN: 0.0043
  - k-Means: 0.38
  - Agglomerative Clustering: 0.35

## Performance Comparison
### DBSCAN Outperformance: 
DBSCAN excels when clusters are non-spherical, have complex shapes, or have significant noise in the datasets (e.g., ‘make_moons’). It automatically discovers clusters of arbitrary shapes, unlike k-Means and Agglomerative, which assume spherical clusters, leading to incorrect partitions in the crescent-shaped data.

### DBSCAN Failure Datasets: 
DBSCAN struggles with datasets where clusters have varying densities (‘make_blobs’). Choosing/tuning the appropriate ‘eps’(0.3) and ‘min_samples’ parameters is difficult, as a single ‘eps’ value may not fit all clusters, leading to under-clustering (some points are labeled as noise) or over-clustering (merging clusters). 
  
The ‘make_circles’ dataset silhouette score for DBSCAN is very low (0.0043). This suggests it failed to detect meaningful clusters, likely because the eps value is not suitable for this structure.

k-means and Agglomerative Clustering perform better here because they assume spherical clusters and can force clusters even when natural clusters are unclear. 

## Trade-offs
- **DBSCAN:**
  - Good for complex shapes (moons)
  - Robust to noise
  - Sensitive to density variations (blobs) 
  - Requires parameter tuning (eps and min_samples).

- **K-Means:**
  - Fast and simple
  - good for spherical clusters (blobs)
  - Assumes equal cluster sizes
  - Requires pre-defining the number of clusters
  - Sensitive to outliers.
  
- **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative):**
  - No need to predefine clusters 
  - Offers hierarchical insights
  - But it is computationally expensive and Assumes structure in data.
