# Clustering Algorithm Comparison: DBSCAN, K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering
Assignment 4: Survival Analysis

# Description
This assignment compares three clustering algorithms: DBSCAN, k-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering using synthetic datasets generated by sklearn.datasets. The goal is to assess the performance of each algorithm based on clustering accuracy and silhouette scores across different datasets, including "moons," "blobs," and "circles."
This assignment applies and compares three survival analysis methods: Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox Proportional Hazards regression, and Random Survival Forests (RSF) using the head and neck cancer patients' clinical dataset, sourced from the Cancer Imaging Archive. The focus is to understand, compare, and reflect on the methods' utility in clinical decision-making.
